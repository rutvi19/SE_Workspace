1.Overview of it industry?..

What is program?..
theory exercise...

1.....Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions. 
---> program is instructions for a computer to execute specific tasks.it is the set of instruction to convert the code into machine code
 function is block of organised and resuable code ...

lab exercise....

1...Write a simple "Hello World" program in two different programming languages of your choice. Compare the structure and syntax. 
--->     c lan                                                                        
#include <stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}           
==========================
 ---> c++ lan                                                                           		
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
 {
  	cout<<"hello world";
	return 0;
 }

2.....what is programming?..
-->Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions, or code, 
that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems.

---> What are the key steps involved in the programming process? 
step1..program diffination
step2..program analysis
step3..algorithm development
step4..coding and documentation
step5..testing and debugging
step6..maintaince
========================================================================================================
3.....Types of Programming Languages?.. 
-->1.  Procedural Programming
Ex : C Language

2.Object Oriented Programming
Ex: C++

3.Logical Programming
Ex: Prolog Language

4.Functional Programming
Ex: Python

---> What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages? 

high-level languages                                                   low-level languages

1.human-readable and easier                              1.easy to understand for manchine but 
to understand and use 		            less-readable for human

2.portable 			         2.non-portable

3.lower execution speed                                        3.higer execution speed 

4.use syntax and semantics                                   4.binary code and mnemonics

5.ex..java ,python,c++                                             5.assembly languages,manchine languages...

========================================================================================================
4.....World Wide Web & How Internet Works 

...world wide web stands for www...that's collections of sites...
....The Internet works by connecting networks through routers and switches, 
enabling devices to communicate and access content on remote servers...

lab .... Research and create a diagram of how data is transmitted from a client to a server over the internet. 
...clients-->internet--->server


-----> Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication. 
..>>Client:
..Initiates communication by sending requests to the server. 
  >These requests can be for data retrieval, updates, or to perform specific tasks. 
  >Often responds to user actions or inputs, such as clicking a link or submitting a form. 
  >Presents the information received from the server to the user.
  >Examples of clients include web browsers, mobile apps, and other software that interacts with web services.

..>>server:
..Receives and processes requests from clients. 
 >Manages and delivers resources and services, such as web pages, databases, and applications. 
 >Ensures reliable data exchange and handles multiple client requests simultaneously. 
 >Responds to client requests by sending back the requested information or acknowledgment. 
 >Examples of servers include web servers, application servers, and database servers.  
========================================================================================================

5.....Network Layers on Client and Server ?..
..>>there are 3 types of networks...
1.presentation layer..    user interface that clients 
2.application layer..     it is a logical layer and its manages the interations between presentation and data layer...
3.data layer...      this layer is responsible for data storage and its manage by server..

>>>lab....???????????????????????????? Design a simple HTTP client-server communication in any language. 

>>>Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers?..
--->The TCP/IP model is a framework that defines how data is transmitted across computer networks, including the Internet. 
It's a set of protocols, like a set of rules, that ensure communication between devices. 
The model divides the communication process into four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.

--->there are 4 types of tcp/ip..
1.application layer:
..The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. 
For most of us that means email, messaging apps.

2.transport layer:
..the transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices.
 Itâ€™s like sending an insured package.

3.network layer:
..the network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that 
lets computers communicate with one another over the internet.

4.internet layer:
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data 
is sent speedily and accurately. 
This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination.

=========================================================================================================
6...Client and Servers :
--->Explain Client Server Communication?
..>>Client-server communication is a model where a client 
    ->like a web browser or mobile app, requests services or data from a server ->like a web server or database, 
      and the server processes the request and responds back to the client. 

========================================================================================================
7..Types of Internet Connections 
 --->Research different types of internet connections (e.g., broadband, fiber, satellite) and list their pros and cons. 
...>>There are several types of internet connections, including:
        broadband,dial-up, DSL, cable, fiber, satellite, 5G, and fixed wireless.
1.broadband:
pros::global connection,E-commerce,ease of online education,abundunt information...
cons::loss of personal data,fake information,distraction and time wastage,healths concers...

2.fibre:
pros::low power,flexible,less long term expenses,carry lots of data...
cons::high cost at first,difficult to splice,can't carry power to operate other devices..

---> How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
