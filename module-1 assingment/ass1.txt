4.....World Wide Web & How Internet Works 

...world wide web stands for www...that's collections of sites...
....The Internet works by connecting networks through routers and switches, 
enabling devices to communicate and access content on remote servers...

lab .... Research and create a diagram of how data is transmitted from a client to a server over the internet. 
...clients-->internet--->server


-----> Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication. 
..>>Client:
..Initiates communication by sending requests to the server. 
  >These requests can be for data retrieval, updates, or to perform specific tasks. 
  >Often responds to user actions or inputs, such as clicking a link or submitting a form. 
  >Presents the information received from the server to the user.
  >Examples of clients include web browsers, mobile apps, and other software that interacts with web services.

..>>server:
..Receives and processes requests from clients. 
 >Manages and delivers resources and services, such as web pages, databases, and applications. 
 >Ensures reliable data exchange and handles multiple client requests simultaneously. 
 >Responds to client requests by sending back the requested information or acknowledgment. 
 >Examples of servers include web servers, application servers, and database servers.  
========================================================================================================

5.....Network Layers on Client and Server ?..
..>>there are 3 types of networks...
1.presentation layer..    user interface that clients 
2.application layer..     it is a logical layer and its manages the interations between presentation and data layer...
3.data layer...      this layer is responsible for data storage and its manage by server..

>>>lab....???????????????????????????? Design a simple HTTP client-server communication in any language. 

>>>Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers?..
--->The TCP/IP model is a framework that defines how data is transmitted across computer networks, including the Internet. 
It's a set of protocols, like a set of rules, that ensure communication between devices. 
The model divides the communication process into four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.

--->there are 4 types of tcp/ip..
1.application layer:
..The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. 
For most of us that means email, messaging apps.

2.transport layer:
..the transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices.
 Itâ€™s like sending an insured package.

3.network layer:
..the network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that 
lets computers communicate with one another over the internet.

4.internet layer:
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data 
is sent speedily and accurately. 
This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination.

=========================================================================================================
6...Client and Servers :
--->Explain Client Server Communication?
..>>Client-server communication is a model where a client 
    ->like a web browser or mobile app, requests services or data from a server ->like a web server or database, 
      and the server processes the request and responds back to the client. 

========================================================================================================
7..Types of Internet Connections 
 --->Research different types of internet connections (e.g., broadband, fiber, satellite) and list their pros and cons. 
...>>There are several types of internet connections, including:
        broadband,dial-up, DSL, cable, fiber, satellite, 5G, and fixed wireless.
1.broadband:
pros::global connection,E-commerce,ease of online education,abundunt information...
cons::loss of personal data,fake information,distraction and time wastage,healths concers...

2.fibre:
pros::low power,flexible,less long term expenses,carry lots of data...
cons::high cost at first,difficult to splice,can't carry power to operate other devices..

---> How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet? 
...Broadband is a general term for high-speed internet access using various technologies like DSL, cable, and satellite. Fiber-optic internet, on the other hand, is a specific type of broadband that utilizes light transmitted through thin glass or plastic fibers, offering faster and more reliable speeds compared to traditional broadband. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. Technology:
Broadband:
      Refers to any high-speed internet connection, including technologies like:
     ..DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Uses existing phone lines for internet access. 
     ..Cable: Uses existing TV cable infrastructure for internet access. 
     ..Satellite: Uses satellite technology to provide internet access in remote areas. 
     ..Fiber-optic:
    Specifically uses light pulses transmitted through fiber optic cables to carry data. 
2. Speed and Reliability:
Broadband:
     ..Speeds can vary depending on the technology used. For example, DSL may be slower than cable, and both may be slower and less reliable than fiber optic. 
    ..Fiber-optic:
    ..Generally offers faster and more reliable speeds, with less latency and interference compared to traditional broadband methods. 
3. Infrastructure:
Broadband:
     ..Can utilize existing infrastructure like phone lines, TV cables, or satellite technology. 
    ..Fiber-optic:
    ..Requires a dedicated fiber optic cable network to be installed, which can be more expensive and time-consuming to implement. 
4. Advantages:
     ..Fiber-optic:
     ..Offers superior speed, reliability, and lower latency, making it ideal for demanding applications like streaming, gaming, and online video conferencing.
Broadband:
     ..Can be more affordable and readily available in some areas, making it a viable option for users with lower speed requirements. 
   ..In essence: Broadband is a broader term for high-speed internet, while fiber-optic is a specific technology within that category that offers superior performance.

What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols? 
---> http                                                                                         https
1. function at the appliction layer                                        1.this is runs at the transport layer.
                       
2.  lacks security.                                                                      2.to protect the communication between server and client.        

3.operates by default on port 80.                                        3.operates by default on port 443.

4.data exchanged in the plain text,                                     4. data exchanged in the chiper,                                      
and it's not encrypted brfore ending.                                     or encrypted text.

9.Application Security :
-->Identify and explain three common application security vulnerabilities. Suggest possible solutions. 

..>Three common application security vulnerabilities are Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and SQL Injection.
    Broken Authentication allows attackers to bypass login mechanisms, XSS enables them to inject malicious scripts into web pages, and SQL Injection allows manipulation of database queries. 
    Solutions include implementing multi-factor authentication,using output encoding and input validation to prevent XSS, and using parameterized queries to protect against SQL Injection.
