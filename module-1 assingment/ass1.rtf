\par
5.....Network Layers on Client and Server ?..\par
..>>there are 3 types of networks...\par
1.presentation layer..    user interface that clients \par
2.application layer..     it is a logical layer and its manages the interations between presentation and data layer...\par
3.data layer...      this layer is responsible for data storage and its manage by server..\par
\par
.Design a simple HTTP client-server communication in any language. \par
-->clients-->internet-->server..>>daigram-1\par
\par
\par
>>>Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers?..\par
--->The TCP/IP model is a framework that defines how data is transmitted across computer networks, including the Internet. \par
It's a set of protocols, like a set of rules, that ensure communication between devices. \par
The model divides the communication process into four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.\par
\par
--->there are 4 types of tcp/ip..\par
1.application layer:\par
..The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. \par
For most of us that means email, messaging apps.\par
\par
2.transport layer:\par
..the transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices.\par
 It\'e2\'80\'99s like sending an insured package.\par
\par
3.network layer:\par
..the network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that \par
lets computers communicate with one another over the internet.\par
\par
4.internet layer:\par
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data \par
is sent speedily and accurately. \par
This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination.\par
\par
=================================================================\par
6...Client and Servers :\par
--->Explain Client Server Communication?\par
..>>Client-server communication is a model where a client \par
    ->like a web browser or mobile app, requests services or data from a server ->like a web server or database, \par
      and the server processes the request and responds back to the client. \par
\par
=================================================================\par
7..Types of Internet Connections \par
 --->Research different types of internet connections (e.g., broadband, fiber, satellite) and list their pros and cons. \par
...>>There are several types of internet connections, including:\par

\par
2.fibre:\par
pros::low power,flexible,less long term expenses,carry lots of data...\par
cons::high cost at first,difficult to splice,can't carry power to operate other devices..\par
\par
---> How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet? \par
...Broadband is a general term for high-speed internet access using various technologies like DSL, cable, and satellite. Fiber-optic internet, on the other hand, is a specific type of broadband that utilizes light transmitted through thin glass or plastic fibers, offering faster and more reliable speeds compared to traditional broadband. \par
Here's a more detailed breakdown:\par
\par
1. Technology:\par
Broadband:\par
      Refers to any high-speed internet connection, including technologies like:\par
     ..DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Uses existing phone lines for internet access. \par
     ..Cable: Uses existing TV cable infrastructure for internet access. \par
     ..Satellite: Uses satellite technology to provide internet access in remote areas. \par
     ..Fiber-optic:\par
    Specifically uses light pulses transmitted through fiber optic cables to carry data.\par
 \par
2. Speed and Reliability:\par
Broadband:\par
     ..Speeds can vary depending on the technology used. For example, DSL may be slower than cable, and both may be slower and less reliable than fiber optic. \par
Fiber-optic:\par
    ..Generally offers faster and more reliable speeds, with less latency and interference compared to traditional broadband methods. \par
\par
3. Infrastructure:\par
Broadband:\par
     ..Can utilize existing infrastructure like phone lines, TV cables, or satellite technology. \par
 Fiber-optic:\par
    ..Requires a dedicated fiber optic cable network to be installed, which can be more expensive and time-consuming to implement. \par
\par
4. Advantages:\par
     ..Fiber-optic:\par
     ..Offers superior speed, reliability, and lower latency, making it ideal for demanding applications like streaming, gaming, and online video conferencing.\par
Broadband:\par
     ..Can be more affordable and readily available in some areas, making it a viable option for users with lower speed requirements. \par
   ..In essence: Broadband is a broader term for high-speed internet, while fiber-optic is a specific technology within that category that offers superior performance. \par

=================================================================\par
9.Application Security :\par
-->Identify and explain three common application security vulnerabilities. Suggest possible solutions. \par
\par
..>Three common application security vulnerabilities are Broken Authentication, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and SQL Injection.\par
\par
    Broken Authentication allows attackers to bypass login mechanisms, XSS enables them to inject malicious scripts into web pages, and SQL Injection allows manipulation of database queries.\par
 \par
    Solutions include implementing multi-factor         authentication,using output encoding and input validation to prevent XSS, and using parameterized queries to protect against SQL Injection. \par
\par
-->What is the role of encryption in securing applications? \par
\par
  Encryption plays a crucial role in securing applications by transforming sensitive data into an unreadable format, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.\par
Data Protection:\par
Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or stolen, it remains unreadable without the decryption key. This protection extends to data stored on devices, within databases, and during transmission over networks. \par
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication:\par
Encryption helps maintain the confidentiality of data by making it inaccessible to unauthorized parties. It also ensures data integrity by verifying that the data has not been tampered with during transmission or storage. Furthermore, it can be used for authentication, confirming the identity of the sender or receiver. \par
Application Security:\par
Encryption is a key component of application security, protecting data handled by applications from various threats. It can be implemented at different layers of an application, including the application layer, disk layer, and database layer. \par
Regulatory Compliance:\par
Encryption is often required by regulatory frameworks like PCI DSS and GDPR to protect sensitive data.\par

\tab    void main()\par
\tab    \{\par
\tab\tab\tab printf("hello world");\par
\tab    \}\par
\tab    getch();\tab\par
\par
--> What is the difference between source code and machine code? \par
\par
\par
\tab -->Source Code: \par
Human-readable: Written in languages like Python, Java, C++, or C#, understandable by programmers.\par
\par
High-level: Uses abstractions and syntax that programmers find intuitive.\par
\par
Not directly executable: Requires translation into machine code.\par
\par
Example: print("Hello, world!") in Python. \par
\par
\par
-->Machine Code:\par
Machine-readable: A series of binary digits (0s and 1s) representing instructions.\par
\par
\par
Low-level: Closest to the hardware, understood directly by the CPU.\par
\par
Executable: Directly processed by the computer's processor.\par
\par
Example: A sequence like 01101001 00000000 00000011.\par
\par
